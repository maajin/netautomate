import requests

# Set the base URL for the Firemon API
base_url = "https://<firemon-server>/api/1.0"

# Set the API endpoint for retrieving firewall configurations
endpoint = "/configurations"

# Set the API key for authenticating with the Firemon API
api_key = "<api-key>"

# Set the headers for the API request
headers = {
    "Content-Type": "application/json",
    "Authorization": f"Api-Key {api_key}",
}

# Send the API request to retrieve the firewall configurations
response = requests.get(base_url + endpoint, headers=headers)

# Check the status code of the response
if response.status_code == 200:
    # If the request was successful, the firewall configurations will be in the response data
    firewall_configurations = response.json()
    # You can then iterate through the firewall configurations and save them to a file or do whatever else you need to do with them
    for firewall_config in firewall_configurations:
        print(firewall_config)
else:
    # If the request was not successful, there may be an error in the request or the API may be down
    print("An error occurred while retrieving the firewall configurations:", response.text)
Note that this is just a basic example and you may need to modify it to fit your specific needs and requirements. You may also need to consult the Firemon API documentation for more information on the available endpoints and parameters.




Write a python script to download all firewall configurations from Firemon and store it ins a folder.
To download all firewall configurations from Firemon and store them in a folder, you can use the following Python script:

Copy code
import requests
import os

# Set the base URL for the Firemon API
base_url = "https://<firemon-server>/api/1.0"

# Set the API endpoint for retrieving firewall configurations
endpoint = "/configurations"

# Set the API key for authenticating with the Firemon API
api_key = "<api-key>"

# Set the headers for the API request
headers = {
    "Content-Type": "application/json",
    "Authorization": f"Api-Key {api_key}",
}

# Send the API request to retrieve the firewall configurations
response = requests.get(base_url + endpoint, headers=headers)

# Check the status code of the response
if response.status_code == 200:
    # If the request was successful, the firewall configurations will be in the response data
    firewall_configurations = response.json()

    # Set the path to the folder where you want to save the firewall configurations
    folder_path = "<path-to-folder>"

    # Create the folder if it does not already exist
    if not os.path.exists(folder_path):
        os.makedirs(folder_path)

    # Iterate through the firewall configurations and save them to a file
    for firewall_config in firewall_configurations:
        # Set the name of the file
        filename = f"{firewall_config['name']}.txt"
        # Set the full path to the file
        file_path = os.path.join(folder_path, filename)
        # Write the firewall configuration to the file
        with open(file_path, "w") as f:
            f.write(firewall_config["configuration"])
else:
    # If the request was not successful, there may be an error in the request or the API may be down
    print("An error occurred while retrieving the firewall configurations:", response.text)
